# Engineering Spec Quality Checklist: WhatsApp Coupon Template Button

**Purpose**: Validate the engineering spec before planning or implementation
**Created**: 2026-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Origin

- [x] Product Spec is `none`, and the origin section matches the format required by the constitution, field for field
- [x] Problem and acceptance criteria are concrete and observable
- [x] Every acceptance criterion maps to a test in this repository

## Technical Completeness

- [x] Scope in this repository is bounded, and what other repos own is named
- [x] Current state references real paths in this codebase
- [x] Technical approach names the components affected and the flow between them
- [x] Every changed public interface appears in Contracts with its SemVer impact
- [x] Backward compatibility or a deprecation path is stated for each breaking change
- [x] Data model and migration reversibility are covered, or the feature persists nothing
- [x] Peak load is declared as a peak, with its window
- [x] Observability states what is logged, with which context, and which correlation identifier
- [x] Failure handling states timeouts, retriable failures, bounds and idempotency
- [x] The trust boundary and the server-side authorization check are identified

## Verifiability

- [x] Every success or acceptance criterion maps to a test in this repository
- [x] Flow coverage covers complete use cases, not only isolated methods
- [x] Failure paths are covered, not only the success path
- [x] Rollout and rollback are described, and rollback is safe

## Constitution

- [x] Every principle this feature touches has a row in Constitution Alignment
- [x] Every departure from a MUST is justified in the spec, not left to the code
- [x] No obligation of the constitution is left as an unfilled placeholder

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1: all items pass. Origin is engineering-only (no Product Spec). RapidPro/Mailroom are named as passthrough; Courier owns Graph `coupon_code` mapping.
